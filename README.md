  - We follow a Pay as you go model in which user can watch content with a money stream according to the flowrate set by the streamer if he/she/they decides to make        it payable and many more exciting features which will create a ultimate OG Video streaming platform . 
  - Twitch+Discord+Youtube+Buy Me a Coffee = PeerStreams 
  - User can Video Chat,Group chat,send donations ,receive notifications mainly using Push Notifications (Bold)

5. **Proposal Category**
    - Streaming

6. **Project Overview**

    ## The problem we are solving :

    - Recently on youtube the biggest crypto channel called ‚ÄúBankless‚Äù was banned and disappeared with which the hard work and hundreds of hours of content was gone         like huff which is not fair and this is not a single case there are channels which are getting strikes and getting banned without any major reasons . 

    - For seeing a video content of 5 mins ,i have to watch two adds of 30 seconds which is becoming frustrating day by day in youtube .

    - Generally streamers have their discord channels for engaging with their users for which they have to go back and forth for sending notifications about their            streams and interact with the audience.

    - The ownership of the content is not in the creator's hand and is at the risk of being de-platformed anytime.

    ## The solution :
    - Now to solve the above issue we created a decentralized video streaming platform built over Livepeer on which the user will be the true owner of his content by         minting his videos as Nfts on our platform on IPFS network.

    - We will have In-Build Push Channels which the streamer can create once and can use it to interact with his/her audience and also send notifications about his           streams from the platform itself from which he is streaming.

    - Users can see notifications of their favourite streamers on our platform .

    - User can mark video nfts as favourite and we will be keeping a track of that in our smart contract and the videos will be shown on our dapp.

    - Important details about the channel like subscribers,minted video Nfts ,channel info like twitter,website and other social links of streamer will be stored on a       smart contract of which he will be the owner.

    - Viewer can see streamer‚Äôs publications like posts and images published on lens protocol in the Channel section of the streamer.

    - As the number of streamer increases on our platform more content will be uploaded on livepeer and more people will be seeing content transcoded by livepeer.
    
    - Inbuilt Merch Store of Streamers.
    
    - The user can video chat with their favorite streamer which will be a paid feature.

    - Viewer can send donations to streamer using superfluid money streams and those notifications about the donations will be sent in push channels.

    - The donation notifications will be having a message with it which will be converted into a voice message which the streamer can hear.

    - Whenever the user goes live ,he/she/they can send the notification about their stream.

7. **Value Proposition to Push Protocol** 

      We believe this grant will allow foster a long term relationship between PeerStreams and Push to help out with any of video streaming needs . We will be very           interested to onboard you as one of our first grant partner.

      Push Channels will be the main component in our application for following features :

      - Notifications about a streamer going online.

      - Notifications about Donations from viewer to streamer.

      - One to One Chatting with the streamer.

      - Video chatting with streamer.

      - As the user base increases for our platform ,more and more people will be using push in their daily life. 

      - As new streamers come to our platform,new PUSH Channels will be created and more notifications will be sent . 

      - We have experienced Youtube and Twitch notifications and chatting ,we want to do that but in a decentralized manner and with end -to - end encryption with PUSH.
